# creditcard-approval-prediction
The goal of a credit scoring model is to classify credit applicants into two classes: the “good credit” class that is liable to reimburse the financial obligation and the “bad credit” class that should be denied credit due to the high probability of defaulting on the financial obligation.
Credit score cards are a common risk control method in the financial industry. It uses personal information and data (historical data) submitted by credit card applicants to predict the probability of future defaults and credit card borrowings. The bank can decide whether to issue a credit card to the applicant or not. Credit scores are based on historical data and it can quantify the magnitude of risk.
